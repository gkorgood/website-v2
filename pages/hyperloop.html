        <p>Hyperloop is a conceptual, high-speed transportation system initially proposed by Elon Musk. The concept consists of passenger and cargo pods being propelled at up to 760 mph in a low pressure tube using sustainable and cost-efficient energy. To accelerate its development, SpaceX is hosting a competition for engineering teams to design their own hyperloop pods and test them at their facility in Hawthorne, California.</p>
